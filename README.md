Twatter project (Twitter/X Offshoot)

Goals:
  -Give users the ability to post twats (tweets) anonymously.
  -All twats are displayed immediately after posting.

Brief Reflection:
Throughout this semester, I embarked on an enriching journey of learning and developing applications using Java, React, and Vite. This combination of technologies presented a unique blend of back-end and front-end development experiences.

Challenges Faced:
One of the significant challenges was integrating React with a Java backend. Ensuring seamless data flow and handling course policies required careful attention and troubleshooting. 
Vite, being a newer and faster build tool, posed initial setup challenges, particularly with its configuration and optimization for best performance in a Java and React environment.

Lessons Learned:
The process greatly enhanced my understanding of asynchronous programming and state management in React. Learning to use Vite taught me the importance of efficient bundling and fast reloading for modern web development. 
The experience has also improved my problem-solving skills, especially in debugging and integrating disparate technologies.

Future Improvements:
Looking forward, I am eager to explore more advanced state management solutions in React, such as Redux or Zustand, to handle more complex application states. Additionally, I plan to refine the integration of Vite with Java by exploring more plugins and tools that enhance their interoperability. 
Implementing automated testing and continuous integration would be crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring reliability.

Conclusion:
This semester not only bolstered my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in persistence and adaptability. I look forward to applying these skills and insights in future projects, continually improving and expanding my capabilities as a developer.
